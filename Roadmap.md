# Bioinformatics Roadmap
Biological research has become data intensive, recently the high throughput techniques produce massive sets of data at an ever increasing pace. 
These data is used to answer different biological questions using relevant bioinformatic skills. As a student or new researcher you need to understand the main 
computational biology domain knowledge to have a successful career in bioinformatics. A student or new researcher needs to equip himself/herself with an in-depth 
knowledge of the specific problem that is researched and gain essential ingredients of each discipline only to the extent required to address the research questions 
posed [[1]](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-10-S15-S1). 

There are a wide range of research topics in the bioinformatics field. Becoming an expert of a given research topic is the first step on the steep climb to a successful career.
I am going to break down some of the major research areas/topics and the core skills required to conduct analysis.

- ## Reproducible research

- ## High performance computing

- ## RNA-Seq 

- ## Metagenomics

- ## Natural Proccessing Language (NPL)

- ## Machine Learning (ML)
