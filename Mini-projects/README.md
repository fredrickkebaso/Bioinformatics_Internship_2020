We have introduced you to the fundamental concepts; the next step is to move the learning a notch higher, put the skills into practice, and acquire hands-on experience. We are exploring two types of genomic data: RNA-seq and 16S. For the projects, the intention is to develop a working pipeline based on the H3ABioNet SOP and ultimately test on the genomic data generated at *icipe*.  

The next step, which is part of a broader focus to improve reproducibility, is to generate standard pipelines for the typical genomic analysis. We will then configure these pipelines on Galaxy for ease of reuse by researchers.

As highlighted in each project, you are expected to:
- Generate a working pipeline
- Write a report describing the pipeline, discussing the results, and highlighting the challenges
- Fully understand why you made various choices throughout the analysis. Where possible, test various tools
